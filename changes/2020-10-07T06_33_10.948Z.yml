  - name: Search Beta
    summary: >
      The new search is now available for testing. To make it easier for me to
      keep track of bugs or catastrophes, the beta search will only be available
      to Patrons and Moderators. Access will open up to everyone else once it is
      deemed stable enough for a large amount of testers.

      Only available for game pages for now. It will be extended to user pages,
      the home, and the main search before the beta ends.

      To opt-in, go to a game page and click "Try out the beta search!".
