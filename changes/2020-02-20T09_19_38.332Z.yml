      The projects feature that nobody asked for is now live starting with the Wii U Library project!  

      https://www.steamgriddb.com/projects/wii-u  


      Projects will be used as a way to have a concentrated effort to create assets with a specific goal in mind and track progress while doing it.  

      These are considered to be long-term and aren't expected to be 100% complete at all. (But hey I won't stop you guys from trying anyway :wink:)


      If you feel the itch to create assets but don't know what to work on, this would be a great start.

      The Wii U was chosen as the first project for several reasons:  

      1. There's no more games being released for it anymore so i don't have to assign or add more games from the eShop too often.  

      2. The Wii U doesn't have as much shovelware as Steam so it should be relatively easy to find art to work with.  

      3. The amount of games released for the Wii U is nothing compared to other platforms.


      I spent around 2 weeks scraping the eShop and assigning each game to the proper game in the database.  

      As a result, API users can easily query for assets via the eShop title key, product code, or the shop uid.


      More projects will come depending on how this is received.
